# Windows-7-Telemetry-Eliminator
Removes all Windows 7's telemetry updates without removing any necessary updates like some telemetry-removing scripts did. Also disables telemetry tasks and services. No need to block Microsoft's telemetry URLs/IPs. All the updates functions are mentioned in the script, removes Upgrade to Windows 10 notifications (updates).
